       <h3>Description</h3>
       
       <p>I’m a firm believer that a truly great hamburger doesn’t require a lot of ingredients.  You only need a handful of seasonings and some good ground beef.  The beef you use for burgers makes all the difference.</p>
        

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>1/2 pounds 80% lean 20% fat ground beef or ground chuck</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
        <ul>4 slices of cheese</ul>
        <ul>4 hamburger buns</ul>
        <ul>Hamburger toppings - lettuce tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.</ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>     
            <li>Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take 1/4 of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into the shape of a hamburger patty that is about 3/4 inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the patty to prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4 hamburgers.</li>
            <li>Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook an additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.</li>
            <li>If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers off the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.</li>
            <li>Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.</li>
        </ol>
