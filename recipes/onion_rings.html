        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Who doesn't love crispy onion rings? Goes perfectly with beer, wings, burgers, etc. Personally I love dipping these with a mixture of mayo and ketchup, but you can't go wrong with these rings. </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices</ul>
        <ul>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoons baking powder</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoons salt</ul>
        <ul>1 egg</ul>
        <ul>1 cups milk</ul>
        <ul>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</ul>
        <ul>seasoned salt to taste</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons oil for frying</ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
            <li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
